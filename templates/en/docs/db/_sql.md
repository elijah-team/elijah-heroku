### SQL Migrations

If you don't want to use Fizz, or you have a complicated query you want to execute, you can use SQL.

To generate a new **empty** migration, use the following command:

```bash
$ soda generate sql name_of_migration
```

Running this command will generate the following files:

```text
./migrations/20160815134952_name_of_migration.up.sql
./migrations/20160815134952_name_of_migration.down.sql
```

Further info about this command can be found by using the `--help` flag:

```bash
$ soda g sql --help

Generates Up/Down migrations for your database using SQL.

  soda generate sql [name] [flags]
