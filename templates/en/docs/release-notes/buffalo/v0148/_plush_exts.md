## Template File Extensions

In an effort to make future versions of Buffalo more extensible in regards to file processors and templating systems, Buffalo has introduced multiple file extensions, similar to Rails.

In this release, when running `buffalo fix`, all `.html`, `.js`, and `.md` files in the `templates/` directory will be renamed to `.plush(.html|.md|.js)`. All files generated by Buffalo will also have these extensions.

This release also fixes issues with multiple files of different extensions being generated, as well as properly supporting files with multiple extensions, such as those used for internationalization.

**Warning**: `buffalo fix` command will not patch your actions files, so you'll need to fix render calls yourself:

e.g. `r.HTML("list.html")` becomes `r.HTML("list.plush.html")`.

`buffalo fix` command also won't take care of plush partials calls, you'll need to fix them too:

e.g. `\<%= partial("partials/beatles.md") %>` becomes `\<%= partial("partials/beatles.plush.md") %>`.
